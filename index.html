            <h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>
            <h3>1. Distributed StatEngine for Big Data Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Designed and implemented a highly optimized data partitioning system for big data workloads, enabling efficient parallel processing. 
                This solution significantly improved the performance and scalability of data-heavy applications.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Microservices Migration & Performance Tuning</h3>
            <p>
                Transformed EJB applications into microservices using Spring Boot, enhancing maintainability and scalability. 
                Introduced Elasticsearch integration and query converters to optimize data retrieval and system performance.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Machine Learning-Driven Weight Prediction</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a machine learning layer for weight prediction, accelerating processing time by 3X and improving system stability. 
                Leveraged TensorFlow and AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment.
            </p>

            <h3>4. JVM Memory Prediction and Optimization Using Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Created a memory prediction model using machine learning techniques to optimize JVM memory allocation, 
                resulting in a 4X improvement in backend system performance.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Hackathon Participation (4th Place)</h3>
            <p>
                Placed 4th in a recent hackathon, where I collaborated on developing innovative solutions, 
                enhancing my skills in collaboration, quick problem-solving, and delivering high-quality code under pressure.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Kaggle Projects & Competitions</h3>
            <p>
                Actively participating in Kaggle competitions, including the Titanic dataset and the ARC Prize 2024.
